# Data Visualization Using Python

A comprehensive Jupyter notebook tutorial covering data visualization using Matplotlib, one of the most popular plotting libraries in Python.

## Overview

This notebook provides hands-on examples and practical demonstrations of creating various types of plots and charts using Matplotlib. It's designed for beginners and intermediate users who want to learn or improve their data visualization skills in Python.

## Contents

The notebook covers the following topics:

- **Basic Setup**: Importing required packages (Matplotlib, Pandas, NumPy)
- **Line Plots**: Creating simple and customized line charts with markers, colors, and labels
- **Bar Charts**: Horizontal and vertical bar charts with customization options
- **Data Visualization**: Working with real-world data using Pandas DataFrames
- **Plot Customization**: Adding titles, labels, legends, colors, and styling
- **Multiple Plots**: Creating subplots and visualizing multiple datasets

## Requirements

To run this notebook, you'll need the following Python packages:

```python
matplotlib
